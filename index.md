## Welcome to SysResLab - Computer Systems Research Group
# Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa

We are living in exciting times in which we witness the emergence and flourishing of applications such as Neural Computing, Machine Learning, IoT, Blockchain, Augmented and Virtual Reality, among others. To keep up with the rapid growth in computer application innovations, there is a high demand for computer systems research and development to complement the resource needs of emerging applications. 

To spearhead the research efforts in Computer Systems within the University of Moratuwa, the Department of CSE is launching a Computer Systems Research Group. The research group will focus on a broad spectrum of computer systems research domains including

- Parallel Computing
- Distributed Computing
- Cloud Computing
- High Performance Computing
- Edge Computing
- System Virtualization
- System Performance Engineering
- Energy Efficient Computing
- Computer Architecture
- Enterprise Computing Systems

The inaugural meeting of the research group will be held on the 10th of February 2022 from  2.00pm - 3.00pm
